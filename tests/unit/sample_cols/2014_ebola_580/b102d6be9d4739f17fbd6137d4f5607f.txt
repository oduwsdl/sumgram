PREVAIL VII: Persistence of Ebola Virus in Aqueous Humor and Outcomes of Cataract Surgery in Survivors of Ebola Virus Disease
Home » Citations » PREVAIL VII: Persistence of Ebola Virus in Aqueous Humor and Outcomes of Cataract Surgery in Survivors of Ebola Virus Disease
Summary
Objective: Zaire ebolavirus is a single-stranded RNA virus associated with high morbidity and       mortality. The most recent epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa resulted in       over 11,000 deaths and disabling sequelae among survivors, among which eye complications are       highly represented. Chronic intraocular inflammation and viral persistence may result in       posterior synechiae and cataract formation, resulting in loss of visual acuity and requiring       surgical intervention to resolve. Approximately one out of ten Ebola survivors present with       cataract, most of whom will require intraocular surgery during their lifetime, and many of       whom require intervention in the near future to regain quality of life. For survivors who are       blind from cataract, cataract extraction is necessary to restore visual function, allow       reintegration into society and facilitate performance of activities of daily living.
However, surgical parameters among Ebola survivors are unknown, including whether Ebola viral       RNA persists in aqueous humor, whether additional anti-inflammatory medication is needed, and       the expected degree of improvement in visual function. Moreover, sites of viral persistence       are unknown, and it is unclear if lens tissues removed during cataract surgery may harbor       virus in Ebola-affected eyes. We propose following EVD survivors and control subjects       undergoing cataract surgery to determine visual outcomes among Ebola survivors and explore       detection of the presence of virus in lens tissues. The data will inform both future surgical       intervention and aid in the understanding of the pathophysiology of Ebola-associated eye       disease.
Study Population: Up to 60 Ebola survivors and up to 60 controls will be enrolled. The       accrual ceiling is 120 participants.
Design: This is a prospective, natural history study to evaluate the persistence of Ebola       viral RNA in the eyes of Ebola survivors and assess the response to cataract surgery in       survivors as compared to controls. EVD survivors will first undergo assessment of aqueous       humor for the presence of viral RNA. Survivors testing negative for viral RNA and control       subjects will undergo clinically indicated cataract surgery. Subjects will be evaluated 1       day, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after surgery for safety and visual outcome assessments,       and more often as clinically indicated.
Outcome Measures: The primary outcomes are: 1) the proportion of EVD survivors with evidence       of persistence of Ebola viral RNA in ocular tissue and 2) the comparison of amount of       intraocular inflammation, as measured by average grade of anterior chamber cell by SUN       criteria, between EVD survivors and controls at 1 month and 3 months following cataract       surgery. Secondary outcomes include: 1) the proportion of survivors with at least 20/40 best       corrected visual acuity (BCVA) after cataract surgery, relative to controls; 2) significance       of covariates, age and gender, in logistic regression assessment of viral persistence and       cataract outcomes; 3) post-operative optical coherence tomography results in EVD survivors.
