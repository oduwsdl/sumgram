Renowned chain of low income schools operating in Kenya, Bridge International has been named this year’s winner of Global Shared value award.
The chain of private schools that operates mainly in urban slums and rural areas was recognized for its efforts to improve the quality of life for the less fortunate individuals.
Bridge has a chain of over 400 schools with more than 100,000 pupils in just the eight years it has been in operation in the country.
Its low cost of just Sh640 per month has made it an attraction to many low income earners compared to public institutions that charge exorbitant tuition fees which is illegal despite there being free education.
Though it utilizes the 8.4.4 mode curriculum, its mode of dissemination is different as it utilizes technology on both teachers and pupils through smartphones, hot spot wi-fi and tablets.
“Bridge International Academies was selected by a distinguished international committee of corporate and academic leaders based on metrics developed with KPMG International, Global Action Platform, and the Shared Value Initiative,” read a statement from the institutions’ administration.
It added: “As the Award recipient, Bridge International Academies will also be featured in the 2017 Global Action Report, which will be launched at the United Nations next September."
The Global Shared Value Award is meant to recognize corporations and Small Micro Enterprises(SMEs) for commitment to addressing challenges through business strategy, for creating “shared value,” and for applying enterprise strategies to create sustainable, scalable solutions that improve the quality of life and build prosperity for individuals, communities, regions, and the world.  
In collaboration with KPMG International, the Award was presented by the Global Action Platform, the leading university-business alliance advancing scalable, sustainable solutions for abundant food, health, and prosperity.
